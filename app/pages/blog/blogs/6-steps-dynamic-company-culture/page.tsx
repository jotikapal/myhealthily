									<p>A dynamic company culture is not about beer on draft, or lounges, a snack bar, or a game room, it is much deeper than those things. We have put together 6 steps for your clients to create a dynamic company culture. See how you, as their broker, can help them to build this dynamic culture to better serve employees, customers, and community.</p>

									<h3>1. The Basics are Clear</h3>

									<p>Everyone starts somewhere this we know, so why not start with the simple things your clients may already have in place when working on their company culture. Your client may need to look at the company’s values, mission statement, passion, and vision. These items may be older and might need some tweaking to fit current goals as a company. They may need to change these as needed and ensure they are clear and simple.</p>

									<h3>2. Support The Team- This is Your Time to Shine!</h3>

									<p>Speaking of teams, has your client looked at theirs lately? Are they getting everything they need? This is a great question for them to ask during the current job market. Compensation is at an all-time high and so are expenses, ensure the team is supported in as many ways as possible.</p>

									<p>Support can be more than compensation, it can be paid time off, banking holidays, rolling paid time off to the next year, maternity/paternity/adoption leave, 401k, vesting interest. These are all ways for your clients to show the team that they care about their well-being. Then there is the ability to help them better care for themselves, through health insurance- this is where you come in.</p>

									<p>As a broker or agent using the <a href="/how-it-works">MyHealthily platform</a> you can assist clients in finding the right healthcare coverage solution for their team. This is more than health insurance; it’s a daily benefit of keeping money in client’s and their employee’s pocket. MyHealthily works with 130+ carriers across the United States with full medical coverage, ancillary benefits and so much more for 1-100+ employees. Our platform is here to help your clients save year after year.</p>

									<h3>3. Leaders Lead</h3>

									<p>This may sound a bit redundant, but it may be a good time for them to look at their leadership team, are they putting forth the effort? Are they able to meet the standards of the new vision and mission statement? Their leaders are the lifeline of the company culture. They are the beginning of the culture in many aspects. It is important to give leadership the space to mentor the team, help them grow and feel appreciated in their role.</p>

									<h3>4. Culture is a Feeling</h3>

									<p>Culture is more than values and mission, it isn’t the company logo, and slogan, it’s not how the team dresses or even how they greet the customer. It is so much more than these things- though these make up the outward view of their culture. It is about the ties that bind the team together. It is feeling appreciated, knowing they are supported, and they have space to grow in their field. Creating a dynamic company culture means friendship, understanding, humor, learning, problem-solving and decision-making, working towards a goal together.</p>

									<p>Culture is how the team feels when they are at work, and how they view work when they are at home. For your clients to know where their company can grow it is a good idea for them to talk to the team and ask them to be candid about their views on work. Many companies boast about their amazing culture when in reality they have created unhappy and unfulfilled employees.</p>

									<h3>5. Risks are Encouraged</h3>

									<p>When was the last time their team stepped out of the box, came up with a new idea, and then it was implemented? Your clients can encourage their team to step up and bring ideas to the forefront, then put some of them into place.  If after putting an idea to work and it doesn’t seem to fit the need, make changes, or try something else. Failure is not trying and not succeeding, failure is never trying in the first place.</p>

									<h3>6. Recognition- Above and Beyond</h3>

									<p>Everyone likes to be needed and there is nothing better than hearing you did well at something. It can be as simple as a shout out in a meeting where everyone notes how someone else helped them this week, or a praise board with sticky notes. Thanking someone for being helpful takes seconds to recognize a team members can mean so much. Something so simple helps unify any team, helps leaders be better leaders, and changes a mindset.</p>

									<p>These 6 steps could be a huge shift for a company, or a few small changes that make a world of difference for a team. When your client makes these changes within their company, they will see its effect on the team outside the workplace as well, creating happier, healthier, fulfilled employees who help others feel the same way. Let your clients know today how you as their broker can help them meet these goals.</p>
