                        <h3>5. Tracking Technologies and Cookies</h3>
                        <p>We use cookies and other tracking technologies (including from Google, Facebook and LinkedIn) to keep, and sometimes track, information about you on our Services. Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies track where you travel on the Services and what you view. In doing so, a cookie may enable us to relate your use of the Services to your Personal Information.</p>
                        <p>We use information gathered from these tracking technologies so that we can analyze trends, administer the Services, track users' movements around the Services, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may combine information we obtain through tracking technologies with other Personal Information that we have collected about you in order to make our Services, communications and advertisements more targeted to your interests.</p>
                        <p>Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Services, but your ability to use some areas of our Services will be limited. You may also opt out of targeted advertisements by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page.</p>
                        <p><strong>Do Not Track</strong></p>
                        <p>Please note that the Services are not presently configured to respond to DNT or "do not track" signals from web browsers or mobile devices. As such, we do not recognize or respond to Do Not Track requests.</p>

                        <h3>6. Retention and Security</h3>
                        <p>We will retain your Personal Information for as long as your Account is active, as needed to provide you Services, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
                        <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, when you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number and login credentials), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

To protect your Personal Information, we reserve the right to deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on their behalf.</p>
